# Intro

This library implements advanced derivative techniques to allow for implementation of EOS without any hand-written derivatives.  The name TEQP comes from Templated Equation of State Package.  A paper about teqp is published in [Ind. Eng. Chem. Res.](https://doi.org/10.1021/acs.iecr.2c00237):

Why?

* Implementing an EOS is an error-prone and boring exercise. Automatic differentiation packages are a mature solution for calculating derivatives 
* Algorithms that *use* the EOS can be implemented in a very generic way that is model-agnostic
* ``teqp`` is very fast because it is written in C++, see the profiling in the paper in [Ind. Eng. Chem. Res.](https://doi.org/10.1021/acs.iecr.2c00237)

So far the following EOS are implemented:

* cubic:
    * van der Waals
    * Peng-Robinson
    * Soave-Redlich-Kwong
    * quantum-corrected Peng-Robinson for cryogens
* SAFT*ish*:
    * PC-SAFT (+dipoles, +quadrupoles, but no association)
    * SAFT-VR-Mie (mixtures, but no association)
    * cubic plus association (CPA)
* model fluids
    * Exp-6 (modified Buckingham) from Kataoka
    * square-well from Espíndola-Heredia et al.
    * Two-center Lennard-Jones models (+dipoles, +quadrupoles)
* multiparameter
    * multi-fluid model in the form of GERG
    * GERG-2004 and GERG-2008
    * ammonia+water model of Tillner-Roth and Friend
* Lee-Kesler-Plöcker

What is teqp *not*?:

* A feature-rich property library like NIST REFPROP. It is not intended to be, and other packages will be written that allow for the development of new algorithms. You are also welcome to write your own based upon ``teqp``.
* Written in a new and exciting programming language like [Clapeyron.jl](https://github.com/ClapeyronThermo/Clapeyron.jl) or [FeOS](https://github.com/feos-org/feos).  C++ is a mature and stable language that can be readily embedded into other environments or code bases via shared libraries.

  * Added polar contributions to PC-SAFT and especially SAFT-VR-Mie
    * Implemented are Gray and Gubbins method with various correlation integrals (Gubbins&Twu, Luckas). Implemented but not enabled are those from Gottschalk

  * Added L-J EOS from Kolafa-Nezbeda
  * Added L-J EOS from Johnson
  * Added Mie {11-13}-6 EOS of Pohl et al.

JSON-formatted string to build_multifluid_model

  * Bugfix: Fixed stopping condition in ``mix_VLE_Tx`` (if ``dx`` was negative, automatic stop, missing ``abs``).  See [d87e91e](https://github.com/usnistgov/teqp/commit/d87e91ea10bbbd936993edd02f85a53ccd42817d)

## Install

For all users, you should be able to install the most recent version from PYPI with

``pip install teqp``

## Tests

[![Catch tests via Github Actions](https://github.com/usnistgov/teqp/actions/workflows/runcatch.yml/badge.svg)](https://github.com/usnistgov/teqp/actions/workflows/runcatch.yml)

## Build (cmake based)

Try it in your browser: [![Binder](https://mybinder.org/badge.svg)](https://mybinder.org/v2/gh/usnistgov/teqp/master)

Be aware: compiling takes a while in release mode (multiple minutes per file in some cases) thanks to the use of generic typing in the models.  Working on making this faster...

For example to build the critical line tracing example in visual studio, do:

```
mkdir build
cd build
cmake .. 
cmake --build . --target multifluid_crit --config Release
Release\multifluid_crit
```
On linux/OSX, similar:
```
mkdir build
cd build
cmake .. -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Release
cmake --build . --target multifluid_crit
./multifluid_crit
```
### Random notes for future readers:

* When building in WSL via VS Code, you might need to enable metadata to avoid pages of configure errors in cmake: https://github.com/microsoft/WSL/issues/4257
* Debugging in WSL via VS Code (it really works!): https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/cpp/config-wsl
